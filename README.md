We try to predict whether a given website which was created using JavaScript is vulnerable or not, using the Machine Learning algorithms. We first reduce the dimensionality of the data using the Machine learning technique of Principal Component Analysis. Then, we have used three types of Machine Learning algorithms for Prediction – Regression, Classification and Tree-Learning. Under Regression, we employ the usage of Multiple Linear Regression and Ridge Regression. Under Classification, we use Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. Under Tree-Learning, we use Decision Tree and Random Forest where we use Classification and Regression for both of them.
